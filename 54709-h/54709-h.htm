</div>

<p class='c013'>The clipper ship Aurelian, one of the few survivors of the
old West India trade, had sighted Sandy Hook, and was
making New York harbor after a remarkable voyage from
Belize.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Hartley, her master, was eagerly watching the
approaches to the harbor with his deck glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>By his side stood a man of distinguished appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was tall, sinewy, and would have been considered
handsome were it not for the yellow hue of skin which all
travelers in tropical climes are bound to acquire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil Clifford had traveled the world over. His hobby
was archæology, and as he was a man of large means and a
member of many historical and scientific societies, he was
able to pursue his researches to any extent.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was the only passenger aboard the Aurelian, and was
returning to New York from Honduras with a thrilling
purpose in view.</p>

<p class='c000'>What this purpose was only he and Captain Hartley
knew.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>“I only hope that Mr. Parker received our cable from
Havana, and will be at the wharf to meet us,” remarked
Captain Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So do I,” agreed Clifford. “Is it not possible that he
will come down to meet us in a tug?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain shook his head with a wry face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humph!” he said; “you do not know Gilbert Parker.
He is the most penurious man in America. Do you think
he would put out the money to employ a tug? Depend upon
it—never!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet our cablegram may excite his cupidity. Did you
not specify that it was a matter of moment, involving perhaps
millions?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did, but I do not fancy he would heed that. He is a
very close, snug man of business, this Gilbert Parker. The
Aurelian is all the property he owns in the world and every
cent of profit she turns him in from her voyages he with
miserly proclivity stores away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cecil Clifford’s face wore a determined expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well,” he said, resolutely. “If Mr. Parker does
not see fit to lend the Aurelian for my purpose, I will buy,
charter or build a vessel of my own!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Captain Hartley turned eagerly about.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you do that,” he said with some excitement, “why
may I not enter your service?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And leave Parker?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The old skinflint has no love for me and vice versa,” he
said. “I have sailed the Aurelian for him eight years and
made a mint of money for him. Yet he would not yield me
a bit of sympathy or help were I in trouble or distress. You
cannot blame me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Under such circumstances, no,” replied Clifford. “And
Hartley, it shall be so. You stand by me and I will by you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is agreed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They gripped hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have faith in our enterprise?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment the first mate called down from the ship’s
bridge:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a small tug over yonder making signals to us,
skipper!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley started forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A tug!” he cried. “Answer them at once! Can it
be possible that it is Parker coming to meet us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jove, I hope that is true!” cried Clifford heartily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If so,” said the captain, “he has very radically departed
from all previous custom.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The tug which had signaled the Aurelian now drew momentarily
nearer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon she was within hailing distance, and among her
company the angular form of the owner of the Aurelian was
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ship lay to and the tug ran alongside. The owner
came up the gangway somewhat hastily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, Hartley!” he said, in a brusque sort of way, “you
have brought my ship home safely once more!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think I may claim that, Mr. Parker,” replied the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has the voyage been successful?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The best yet made!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! that is good,” declared Parker, rubbing his dry little
hands while his eyes glittered like beads. “You are very
shrewd, Hartley, and I will admit, faithful. I have gone to
some expense to come out here and meet you. That I will
charge to the deficit account. I am anxious to know the
meaning of your cablegram!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shall know it at once!” replied the captain. “Come
into the cabin. But first, allow me, Mr. Parker, my friend,
Cecil Clifford.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Parker bowed in a perfunctory way, and Clifford said</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“Very much pleased!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a few moments later they were seated in the cabin
at a big table spread with charts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley opened the conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will first tell you a bit of a story, Mr. Parker,” he
said; “it will help to explain matters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Proceed!” said Parker, stiffly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As I must first inform you,” continued the captain,
“Mr. Clifford here is an antiquarian and traveler. He was
some few weeks ago engaged in exploring the interior of
Honduras. In the mountains he found the ruined city of an
ancient race. In exploring the ruins he found a secret chamber
which was completely walled up, save for one small
opening large enough to put a hand through.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In this secret chamber there was a skeleton enclosed in
fragments of armor, such as was worn by the soldiers of
Spain in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here was a mystery, and he at once set himself at work
to solve it. His first assumption was that it was the remains
of one of the early Spanish invaders, who had been made a
prisoner by the natives and shut up here to starve to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And upon the walls of the death cell he found the following
scratched in barely legible characters into the stone:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I, Don Cristobal Mendoza, am thrown into this dungeon
to starve by the heathen, curses upon them! Curses upon
the fortune which placed me in their power.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here I am doomed to die, while my ship, the Donna
Veneta, lies fathoms deep in the ocean, off this cursed coast,
with all my great fortune aboard.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Woe is the day I left sunny Spain with my princely
holdings, to set up a kingdom in this land of deception and
disappointment. Buried at the bottom of the sea is my noble
ship and millions of pesos, while I am to die in this fearful
hole. Jesus pity! Save my soul!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then followed a diagram which was rudely drawn to
show the spot where the Donna Veneta went down. The
whole coast map of Honduras was shown, and so comprehensive
was it that a skipper familiar with the waters
should be able to sail directly to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No latitude or longitude was given, only approximate
distances, but this was deemed enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The diagram was briefly discussed. All the while Parker
had listened with a cat-like gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Mr. Parker,” said Hartley, finally, “what do you
think of it? Is not that treasure worth recovering?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Recovering!” exclaimed the miser, squeakily; “how can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>it be recovered? How can you recover anything from such
a depth in the sea as that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pshaw! There are hundreds of divers who will go down
to the wreck.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If they can find it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are incredulous!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want of me? Is this your reason for calling
me out here at such trouble and expense?” cried the
miser, angrily. “What a bit of moonshine! You are a fool,
Hartley. I gave you credit for more sense. What folly to
think that you could recover such a treasure. Why, it is
absurd—very absurd, sir!”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment Hartley’s face was black. Hot words were
on his tongue, but he only said, in a steely way:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you have no faith in this project?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None whatever!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will not lend the Aurelian to this scheme on promise
of an equal division?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The miser spoke decidedly; Hartley arose quickly to his
feet. He was very resolute and very angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then, Mr. Parker,” he said, “you may look for a new
captain. I am out of your employ this moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Parker gave a violent start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” he cried, “have I not always paid you well?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never without reluctance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you mean to leave me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will you do? You have no ship nor enough of
money to carry out your hare-brained enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But my friend, Mr. Clifford, has,” replied Hartley, coolly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The miser turned and regarded Clifford almost insolently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said the traveler, with assumed nonchalance.
“You have chosen to throw away your golden opportunity,
Mr. Parker. We are not sorry, however, to exclude you from
our enterprise. It is true that I have money enough to build,
buy or charter any kind of a vessel we may desire to accomplish
our purpose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The miser looked keenly at Clifford and then stammered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—I—I will reconsider——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, you won’t,” said Clifford emphatically. “We are
alone in this enterprise, sir. You are excluded!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The miser said no more. But he chuckled much under his
breath. The Aurelian a few hours later was at her wharf.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Captain Hartley and the distinguished traveler took
their leave of the vessel. The captain took the portfolio in
which he had kept the copy of Don Cristobal’s story, among
other effects.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Both proceeded at once to a hotel. Neither were disconcerted
by the decision of Parker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Aurelian is a good vessel,” said Hartley, “but there
are others, Clifford. I am not sorry to leave the old curmudgeon
out of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nor I,” agreed Clifford; “but now, my dear friend, let
us at once get down to business.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='II' class='c010'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>THE YOUNG INVENTOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Clifford’s plan was to buy diving suits, and at once look
up men used to descending into the greatest depths of the
sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these were not easily found. Neither were they at
once successful in finding the right sort of a sailing craft
for their purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>While thus somewhat perplexed a curious incident occurred
which completely changed their plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford chanced to pick up a newspaper and read a large
heading:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c015'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>A Wonderful Invention!</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Frank Reade, Jr., the young inventor, once more to the
fore. This time it is a famous submarine boat which is a
complete success, and with which the wonderful young man
intends to sail around the world under water. The problem
of deep-sea navigation solved. The naval and marine world
in general much interested.”</p>

<p class='c000'>More followed of a descriptive nature, and Clifford read
every line. Then he drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>He arose and put on his hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hartley,” he said, “come with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner of the great traveler impressed the captain.
He looked up in surprise and asked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am going to Readestown.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To Readestown?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To see Frank Reade, Jr.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ask no questions until we get there. Then you will understand
all. Come along!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley knew there was no use in trying to argue the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>point. It was always best to give Clifford his own way. So
he followed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Readestown was a neat little town on a river leading down
to the sea. It was chiefly noted for the family of great inventors,
the Reades, who had founded the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., himself, sat in his private office at the
machine works looking over some plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a tall, handsome youth, with a certain bearing
which distinguished him wherever he went.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the door opened and a woolly head appeared in
the space between the door and the frame.</p>

<p class='c000'>A negro, black as a coal and with gleaming ivories, stood
there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Pomp,” said Frank, looking up, “what is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suah, sah, two gentlemen as wants fo’ to see yo’, sah.
Dey won’t take no, sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank took the cards handed him and glanced at the
names.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Joseph Hartley</span>—<span class='sc'>Cecil Clifford</span>.</div>
      <div class='line in26'>“New York City.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know them,” he said. “What is their business?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Berry important, sah, so dey say. Kain’t tell no mo’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Show them in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A’right, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp disappeared, but he had no sooner vanished than a
shock of red hair and a genial Irish mug appeared in the
spot he had left.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, Misther Frank, ivery bit av the sthores is aboard
the boat, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good for you, Barney O’Shea!” replied the young inventor.
“Everything is then in readiness for the start.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, that will do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The red hair and grinning mug then vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were Frank Reade, Jr.’s faithful body
servants. They had been long in his employ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Steps were heard outside a few moments later, and two
men entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Hartley and Cecil Clifford shook hands with
Frank Reade, Jr. In a very few moments they were the
warmest of friends, so instinctive was the sympathetic tie
between kindred souls.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We understand you have perfected a submarine boat,
Mr. Reade,” said Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is true,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is a wonderful triumph. We congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“Do you intend starting for a deep-sea cruise very soon?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In a very few days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you an object in view beyond simple exploration?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing special.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford and the captain exchanged glances. Then the
former said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you kindly listen to a little story we have to tell,
Mr. Reade?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With pleasure,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Clifford detailed the story of the Donna Veneta and
her treasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he dwelt upon the story of the sunken galleon’s gold,
Frank grew interested.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some moments after Clifford finished his story he was
thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“So Gilbert Parker would not lend his ship Aurelian to
such an enterprise?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which shows his folly. Gentlemen, what if I propose to
place the submarine boat Dolphin at your disposal?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford and Hartley sprang forward, and each grasped a
hand of the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah! You have saved the day!” cried Clifford. “We
knew that you would look with favor on our plans!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only think of having a submarine boat at our disposal!”
cried Hartley. “Success is assured!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, gentlemen, I am decided,” said Frank. “We will
all go aboard the Dolphin in search of the galleon’s gold.
The start shall be made at once, and old Parker will find out
what a colossal old ass he is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley and Clifford cheered vociferously. But Frank
pulled chairs up to the table, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is your plan or diagram?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley pulled out the portfolio and opened it; he spread
some papers on the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were quickly examined, and then all three men
looked at each other blankly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jericho!” gasped Hartley. “Where are the diagrams,
Cecil?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They ought to be here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But they are not!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford and Hartley were aghast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What has become of them?” he gasped, weakly. “My
soul, Hartley, you don’t believe that they have been stolen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stolen!” exclaimed the captain in a hollow voice. “That
is their fate. Cecil, we are ruined men!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank glanced from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Who could have stolen them?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We do not know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To whom else have you shown them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To no one—except——”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford and Hartley stared at each other. Then both
gasped in the same breath:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gilbert Parker!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The old hound!” rejoined Hartley, hotly. “Would he
dare do such a villainous thing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe him capable of anything,” said Cecil. “I know
he is an old villain!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley took several turns up and down the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can prove nothing,” he said. “Of course he will
deny it. Again, perhaps we have lost them. What shall we
do? Can you not repeat that diagram from memory,
Cecil?”</p>

<p class='c000'>In answer, the traveler sat down, and after some time
drew crude lines upon paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is as near as I can remember it,” he said, “but
I lose much valuable detail.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What could have prompted us to attempt to take Parker
into the scheme at all?” cried Hartley, with self anger. “I
might have known that he would try to figure it all into his
own coffers. What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is only one thing,” said Frank, arising.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will accept this diagram and scour every foot of
the Honduras Gulf. We shall have an advantage in the
submarine boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Right!” cried Clifford, in a transport of joy. “There is
a solution of all! We will beat Mr. Parker at his own game!
Mr. Reade, we owe all to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is nothing,” said Frank. “I am with you body and
soul! But enough! Would you not like to take a look at the
Dolphin?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Delighted!” both cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come on, then!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank led the way through high gates into an inner yard.
In the center of this was a deep basin or tank of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was connected with the river several hundred yards below
by means of a canal and a lock.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the center of the tank floated the submarine boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a wonderful specimen of seacraft. The two new-comers
gazed at it spellbound.</p>

<p class='c000'>In shape the Dolphin was long and rakish and her lines
indicated speed. Her hull was of plates of steel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her main deck was roofed over entirely, giving her an odd
appearance as she lay there in the water. In this roof was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>an enormous plate-glass skylight and any number of dead-eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were wholly for purposes of observation from the
interior of the boat. There was a large observation window
and conning tower upon each side of the vessel about midships.</p>

<p class='c000'>A pilot-house with a conical dome and heavy glass windows
was forward. There was an outer deck or platform to
the width of six feet, which extended all around the vessel
and was protected by a guard rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin had three steel masts and a long bowsprit
with rigging of steel ropes. These were more for the steadying
of the craft than practical use.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had twin screws, which were driven by powerful electric
engines on a peculiar storage plan, which was wholly
the invention of Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>So light and clean cut was the Dolphin that she could
make a famous rate of speed even under water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interior of the boat was most palatially furnished.
Every comfort and convenience known to science was there.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the pilot-house to the engine-room, salons, staterooms,
magazine and all were complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was also the huge pneumatic reservoir or tank for
the sinking or rising of the boat. This was done by simply
admitting or expelling water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also the chemical generator, with its tubes extending to
every part of the boat for the furnishing of pure air while
under water. Altogether the submarine boat was a marvel.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='III' class='c010'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Barney and Pomp had faithfully made every preparation
for the submarine cruise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stores sufficient to last two years were aboard the boat.
She was in apple-pie order, her dynamos being ready to
start at an instant’s notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>She rocked lightly in the tank, and as Hartley and Clifford
went aboard of her they were enthused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the great whale!” cried the captain, “she’s the neatest
sea craft I have ever seen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A floating palace!” declared Clifford. “Mr. Reade, this
is no ordinary invention.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” admitted Frank, “she quite excels anything I
have yet manufactured, I admit. Yet I think I can excel
her merits.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Hartley looked incredulous.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It does not seem possible,” he said. “And yet I cannot
dispute you, Mr. Reade. I think anything is quite possible
for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank bowed modestly at this profuse compliment. Then
they all repaired to the office again.</p>

<p class='c000'>A day was agreed upon for the start, and all hands were
to be ready at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was believed that the Donna Veneta could be found
even without the important diagram left by Don Cristobal.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she was a submarine boat, this seemed plausible
enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At any rate,” declared Clifford, “if we can do no better,
we can go into the interior of Honduras and look up the
record in the ruin again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if Parker abstracted the diagram, what was his
purpose?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trio exchanged glances.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps he thinks of getting in ahead of us with the
Aurelian,” ventured Hartley: “it is just like the old hypocrite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, that is so,” agreed Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank Reade, Jr., frowned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will bother him some to locate the Donna Veneta before
we do,” he said. “It is possible that he can do it, but I
don’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So the matter was dropped.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirits of the fortune hunters were high.</p>

<p class='c000'>They could not restrain their exuberance. That night
Hartley and Clifford went back to New York to complete
their preparations.</p>

<p class='c000'>In three days the Dolphin was to begin its submarine
voyage for the Gulf. On the afternoon of the second day
Hartley picked up a daily paper, and as is always a sea
captain’s wont, glanced over the shipping news.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gave a sudden wild start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great whales!” he gasped; “just look at this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He placed his finger on an item. Clifford read it:</p>

<p class='c014'>“S’ld: Thursday, June 5th, the ship Aurelian, Captain
Jed Moore, for the West Indies and Central American
ports.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two men looked stupefied. Then Hartley raised his
finger significantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just as true as you live, Cecil Clifford, that old scoundrel
is going to try and recover the Donna Veneta’s treasure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But he has no right to it!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“What does he care?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be the act of a thief.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is just what he is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley was thoughtful for some while. He knew that
the Aurelian would have a day’s start of the Dolphin. But
could she beat her to Honduras?</p>

<p class='c000'>If Parker really had the diagram he certainly had an advantage,
for he could at once locate the treasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, there is one thing about it,” said Cecil resolutely,
“if we run against him in those waters there will be likely
to be trouble.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t believe Frank Reade, Jr., will take any of their
impudence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nor I.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps we had better let him know about this at once.
Shall we wire him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Better see him in person. Can we not be all ready to
start for Readestown to-day?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see no reason against it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By all means let us go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It did not require much time for the two excited men to
get all in readiness for an early start.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., was not a little surprised when he
heard the report of Parker’s conduct.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is no doubt but that he has gone to Honduras to
recover the treasure,” he said, “but we will beat him at that
game.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” cried Hartley and Clifford in chorus. “We knew
what your sentiments would be, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, that is just what they are,” said the young inventor
resolutely. “We will make trouble for Mr. Parker. He is
entitled to no part of the Veneta’s treasure nor shall he
have it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was in apple-pie order and ready for the
start. A few hours later all were aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will not dwell upon the leave-taking of Readestown.
A large crowd wished the submarine navigators God-speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin a few days later sailed the waters of the
Gulf, and was rapidly on her way to Honduras.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus far she had sailed most of the distance on the surface.
Now, however, Frank decided to proceed the rest
of the way under the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he pressed the valve which filled the reservoir, and the
boat at once began to sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down she settled gracefully beneath the waves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In spite of themselves the voyagers could not help but
feel a curious thrill as they went below the surface, and
knew that they were going to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>There was a brief instant of darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank touched the electric lever and—presto! the
interior of the boat was ablaze with light.</p>

<p class='c000'>And outside the radiance shed far and wide into the sea
depths. Myriads of fish came trooping down through the
translucent mass.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were of thousands of shapes, colors and varieties.
Some of them were so large as to threaten the safety of the
boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>But fortunately these large ones were great cowards, and
kept at a safe distance from the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank turned on the searchlight and sent its rays shooting
down into the depths.</p>

<p class='c000'>As yet the bottom could not be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are we getting down to the center of the earth?” cried
Hartley; “it must be an immense depth here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see nothing of the bottom yet!” cried Clifford. “Can
the little boat stand the strain, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor knit his brows.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, I think so,” he said, but yet looked anxious, for
the Dolphin was creaking and groaning somewhat; “the
bottom must be near. Ah, there, I can see it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And a wonderful sight it was which burst upon the view
of all at that moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were sure at that moment that they were the only
human beings who had ever beheld it at that depth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was like a view into another and strange world.</p>

<p class='c000'>To adequately describe it would be quite impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were forests of marine plants, some of them gigantic
in size, cavernous recesses, the lurking place of strange
sea monsters, and coral reefs deeply submerged in sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin sailed over this wonderful scene, while the
voyagers took it all in spellbound.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the Veneta is sunk in such a sea as this,” declared
Clifford, “it will be difficult enough to get at her on account
of the marine growth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right,” agreed Hartley. “What do you think of
it, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said the young inventor, after some thought, “I
hardly believe that the sea which the Veneta is buried in is
of the same sort as this. While the Gulf of Honduras is undoubtedly
rich in marine growth, yet I believe that there are
greater tracts of sandy plain and coral reef. Let us hope
to find the Veneta in such.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Amen!” cried Clifford. “We will accept no other belief
anyway!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin kept on for miles sailing over the forest of
marine growth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Had the voyagers felt the inclination there would have
been no open space for a safe descent.</p>

<p class='c000'>For to risk a descent among the tangled fibers and
branches of the marine plants would be worse than folly.
Powerful as the Dolphin was, she might not be able to extricate
herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>For hours the submarine boat kept on in this way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was at the helm, while Frank and Hartley and
Clifford sat in the cabin and discussed the subject of locating
the Veneta.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney kept his hand on the Dolphin’s wheel and a sharp
lookout out of the window at the same time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had been at work in the galley.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had finished his cooking and for a moment stood looking
out of his window at the curious sights which seemed
to pass in review before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly he heard Barney in the pilot-house above calling
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, naygur, an’ phwere is the heart av yez? Can yez
bear to see me stharve, yez ill-mannered coon yez?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh!” grunted Pomp. “Why didn’t yo’ say yo’ was
hungry?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, yez have only to luk at me to see that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ am right dar, I’sh; wha’ yo’ loike fo’ to eat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure I’ll take it in liquid form if yez don’t moind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ want some consomme, den?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divil a bit! Yez know phat’s best to warrum the cockles
av me heart.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp chuckled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I done fink I undahstan’ yo’,” he said. “I brung yo’ up
some dreckly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp reached down behind the flour bin and brought
forth from the darkness a black bottle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The label on it read:</p>

<p class='c000'>Good Bourbon Whisky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now everybody knows the Irishman’s weakness; the Englishman
imbibes ale, the German drinks beer, the Frenchman
sips wine, the American brandy, but the true bred
Celt despises all of these, and turns to whisky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp poured a good dose of the pure article into a small
flask; then he did something else.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c010'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>A CATASTROPHE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The two were warm friends, but ever addicted to the
playing of jokes upon each other. Sometimes one had the
better of it, and sometimes the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Pomp saw what he believed an elegant opportunity to
square some past grievances with his friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, I done fix dat chile!” he chuckled. “He laike
whisky, do he? Massy Lordy, I gib him de Keeley Cure!”</p>

<p class='c000'>With which, still chuckling, he reached up and took down
a small bag of ground red dust and seeds, and which was
marked “Ground Red Peppers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” chuckled the darky, “he done fink somefin’ got
him fo’ suah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the flask he put a liberal quantity of the ground peppers.
Then he touched his tongue to the compound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The touch fairly lifted him off his feet. A swallow would
seem sufficient to send a man up in smoke, so hot was it.</p>

<p class='c000'>So delighted was the darky with the prospect that he
yielded to immediate laughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney heard it and cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Phwat the divil ails yez, naygur? Phwat do yez foind
so funny?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp sobered at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was jes’ larfin’ to mahse’f,” he replied hastily, fearful
that he would be suspected.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Laughin’ at yesilf! Well, shure that’s nothin’ to be wondhered
at. But shure will yez hurry up wid the crather?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ hold yo’ patience jes’ a bit till I put dis bread in de
oven!” replied Pomp, “I’se comin’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he picked up the flask and sprang up the stairs.
Barney took it from his hand eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s a gintlemon yez are!” cried Barney, “yez
know well enuff phwat I need.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With which the Celt threw the flask to his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp stood eagerly waiting for the explosion. Gurgle,
gurgle went the liquor down his throat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky stared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Could he believe his senses?</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt slowly and deliberately drained the flask. Then
he laid it down and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, that tastes loike some whisky I once got in
Donnybrook!” he said. “It’s fairly aloive!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp gave a gasp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he picked up the flask and looked at Barney like one
in a dream. His eyes fairly rolled in their sockets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Phwat the divil ails yez!” he cried. “Shure are yez
sick?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“N—no, sah!” replied the dazed coon, “but—did yo’
drink all dat whisky roight down an’——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Phwat the divil did yez expict me to do? Did yez want
a sip yersilf?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“N—no, sah!” spluttered the coon, “but—but——”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>He said no more, but made his way down the stairs slowly
to the galley. There he scratched his woolly pate and
muttered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“On mah wo’d I neber heerd ob sich a mouf an’ stummick
as dat I’ishman hab got. I done fink he make a good meal
on window glass any time he feel laike it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Barney had tasted the most fiery of liquors too many
times to mind a little thing like this. He knew from the
taste that the darky had doctored the liquor, and he suspected
what it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he chuckled to himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, the coon thought he had me solid that toime.
But fer a fact he got badly left, fer divil a bit do I moind
a little foire in the crather.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Barney laid it up against the darky just the same,
and muttered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll foix him fer it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>While Pomp said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I done fink dat I’ishman am cast iron inside. I never
fought he was sich a tough man afore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But for all that, the whisky did affect the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was powerful strong and made Barney feel a bit tipsy.
His hand was not so strong at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a result, an accident occurred. The boat was approaching
a reef at full speed, when Barney’s foot slipped
and he fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before he could regain his feet the wheel spun around,
there was a shock, and everybody was hurled to the cabin
floor. The lights went out, there was a booming of waters
and all was darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boat stood still. Frank Reade, Jr., was the first to
recover himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>He arose and groped his way into the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mither save us!” came a voice from the corner; “shure,
it’s kilt I am intoirely!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney!” cried Frank, “what has happened?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, Misther Frank, divil a bit kin I tell yez. I
think, though, that we have run ferninst a reef, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, that’s pretty work!” cried Frank angrily. “What
do you mean by such stupidity?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, I hope yez will not blame me too much. Me
fut slipped an’ I fell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was nothing to be done but make the best of it,
though Frank gave the Celt a good reprimand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he made haste to examine the exact position of the
submarine boat and her chances.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an affair more than ordinarily serious. The reflection
that they might be immovably fixed on the reef gave all
the voyagers a chill.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The electric lights were quickly turned on, and the engines
carefully inspected.</p>

<p class='c000'>These fortunately were fond to be uninjured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank reversed them, with a view to drawing the boat off
the ledge if possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this was useless. The boat was stuck there, and would
not move. It was a serious case.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was to be done?</p>

<p class='c000'>They were many fathoms deep in the sea. Unless the boat
could be freed from her position on the ledge, their fate
would be too dreadful for contemplation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Doomed to die of starvation at the bottom of the sea. It
was a dreadful thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford was very pale as he approached Frank and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are the chances, Mr. Reade?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rather scant!” he said. “I can give no definite answer
until after I have taken a look at her from the outside.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“From the outside?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford looked surprised.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How can you do that?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easy enough,” replied Frank. “I have a patent diving
suit which I can wear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I am interested,” declared Clifford. “How will
you dare to venture out in these waters in a diving suit? I
should think the pressure would be too great.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not with my new diving suit,” replied Frank. “I have
perfected it so that, as no life line is used, a pressure of almost
any depth can be resisted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Without a life line? How do you breathe?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By means of a chemical generator which is portable and
is carried on the back. It furnishes the best of air and is
similar to the generator which furnishes our boat with
oxygen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wonderful!” exclaimed Clifford. “You are truly a man
of inventions, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is the most simple of all my inventions,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t happen to have two of those wonderful diving
suits, do you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have half a dozen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! Would you mind my putting on one of them and
accompanying you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly you may.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank called to Barney, who brought out the diving suits.
Two of them were selected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Clifford were soon encased in the suits, and
ready to leave the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Each carried a small ax at the girdle. Otherwise they
were unarmed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course there was something to fear from the monsters
of the deep, but neither shrank from the risk. A moment
later they entered the vestibule.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank closed the cabin door and pressed a valve.
Instantly the vestibule filled with water.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an easy matter to open the outer door and walk
out on the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required some moments for both to get accustomed to
the unusual pressure. But after awhile they were enabled
to see and think clearly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank began to descend from the deck to the bed
of the sea. He found solid footing in the sand which covered
that part of the reef.</p>

<p class='c000'>He made his way slowly along to the bow of the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>A glance was enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>The steel ram of the vessel was driven deep into the reef
and seemed immovable. The keel rested in a cleft of coral
which bound it tightly on all sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>So intent was Frank upon examining the position of the
Dolphin that he gave no thought to anything else about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>So it happened that Clifford, who had been engaged in
looking for coral specimens, came near getting into a bad
scrape.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened in this way:</p>

<p class='c000'>He had caught sight of a curious coral growth jutting out
from the reef, and was determined to make an effort to secure
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He clambered up a steep place and placed his hand upon
the coral. At the same moment he noticed an orifice in the
rock just to his right.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even as he did so he fancied he saw the glitter of something
bright beyond. But he gave it no heed.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was Clifford’s mistake.</p>

<p class='c000'>For while reaching for the coral a long, sinewy arm
darted out of the orifice. In an instant it wound itself about
the body of the unsuspecting diver.</p>

<p class='c000'>It wound about him in serpentine fold and he was torn
from his perch and drawn toward the orifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one swift instant Clifford realized his peril and the
character of his foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that the sinewy arm was really the tentacle of a
fierce octopus or sea-cat, and that its horrid jaws were waiting
to mangle him.</p>

<p class='c000'>And he seemed powerless to resist. For a moment he was
dazed with utter horror and indecision.</p>

<p class='c000'>What should he do?</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a problem.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 id='V' class='c010'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>ON THE REEF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In his horror, Clifford forgot himself and shouted wildly
to Frank, but the young inventor did not reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course he could not hear. Indeed, the only way conversation
could be carried on was by placing the helmets
closely together and loudly shouting.</p>

<p class='c000'>So that the young inventor, intent on examining the Dolphin’s
position, thought of nothing else, until by chance he
turned his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the sight which he beheld filled him with horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment he could not act.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God!” he gasped, “Clifford is lost!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then his senses returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>He realized that his friend was in mortal peril, and that
he must go to his aid. At any cost he must try and save him.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he drew his ax from his girdle and made a leap forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meanwhile Clifford had been fighting for all that
was in his power. He wielded his ax with desperate energy.</p>

<p class='c000'>He struck blow after blow at the huge tentacle which held
him so firmly. Each blow threatened to sever it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even as success was crowning his efforts, out darted
another arm and encircled him.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was surely drawing him into the orifice, when Frank
came to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor dealt a terrific blow at the tentacle.
It partly severed it. Another huge arm came stealing out,
and Frank dealt it a blow also.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford was too exhausted to do more. But Frank threw
an arm about him, and dealing the tentacle a severing blow
drew his friend quickly out of reach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing more was seen of the octopus.</p>

<p class='c000'>It did not emerge from its den, but a dense cloud of black
fluid did, and it so clouded the water that Frank was obliged
to drag Clifford some distance away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latter recovered quickly. Frank put his helmet close
and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you all right?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Clifford; “it was a close call!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed it was!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But for you I should have lost my life!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made signs to return to the Dolphin, but Clifford
felt sufficient curiosity to ask:</p>

<p class='c000'>“How about the boat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is but one way to get her off the reef.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“And that——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will explain when we get back to the boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments they reached the rail. To their surprise
they saw Barney in the vestibule, all in his diver’s
suit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brave Celt had seen their distress and was coming to
their rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, Misther Frank!” he cried, when the two divers
were once more safely aboard. “I thought it was the end
av yez. May the Howly Vargin be praised, yez are all roight
an’ safe!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well; I thought our friend, Clifford, was surely done
for,” said Frank, “but by the best of good fortune he is still
with us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which happy fact I owe to Mr. Reade,” declared Clifford.
“I shall never forget it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The matter was dropped now, however, for another important
one. The question as to the fate of the Dolphin was
now brought up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was thoughtful for some while, and finally said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait until to-morrow. Then I will be able to decide.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That night few in the party slept very soundly; at an
early hour Pomp had a steaming breakfast ready.</p>

<p class='c000'>All were rather sober as they sat around the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Frank, “if we are doomed to spend the rest
of our days at the bottom of the sea we can count upon extending
our span of life to a limit of about two years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you make that exact calculation?” asked Captain
Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are just stores enough on board to last two years,”
replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After they are gone?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank laughed nervously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two years is a good long while in which to make up our
minds what to do. Perhaps before that time we may hit
upon a good scheme.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us hope so,” said Clifford; “but we should like to
hear of your scheme of yesterday, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By all means!” cried Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh! neber you mind,” cried Pomp. “Marse Frank he
neber get stuck. He fin’ some way out ob any kin’ ob a
scrape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, that’s roight!” averred Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some reflection and much persuasion Frank divulged
the plan which had occurred to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a simple one,” he said; “it consists merely of digging
a mine under the boat and trying to dislodge her with
dynamite.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“Hurrah!” cried Clifford. “What could be better?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So say I!” said Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are many risks involved,” he said. “We must
consider the possibility of the Dolphin springing a leak, or
of the dynamite straining her timbers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—how can she spring a leak?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her timbers or plates may be already started, and dislodging
her may start the leak in an instant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The faces of all fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there any certainty of such being the case?” asked
Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No certainty,” replied Frank, “only a possibility, and a
very strong one at that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then it is narrowed down to a question of expediency,
whether it is better to risk instant death or the more lingering
fate of two years under the deep sea.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly,” agreed Frank. “If we explode the dynamite
now the boat may fill and sink in ten minutes. There is the
chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Humph!” said Hartley. “If we have got to die it may
as well be now as two years from now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank glanced around the little circle inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do the rest of you say?” he asked. “Shall we accept
the chance?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Put it to ballot,” said Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Agreed!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford made out some ballots and handed them around.
They were marked and thrown on the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley counted them.</p>

<p class='c000'>His face wore an indescribable expression as he looked up
and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The question is settled. The ballot is unanimous.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In favor of——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The dynamite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., arose from his chair. He was very cool
and steady as he said to Barney:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bring up the metal canisters from the hold. Rig a wire
with the battery. Then procure picks and spades, put on
your suits, you and Pomp, and come with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp went for the picks and spades. In a few moments
all was in readiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, with Barney and Pomp, donned diving suits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they went out on deck, and a little later were at the
keel of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank directed the digging of the mine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coral was easily picked away, but the ledge rock required
drilling and splitting.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Slowly but surely the mine was made. All that day the
work went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was noon of the succeeding day, however, before it was
finished. Then the cartridges were placed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Great bales, made of soft burlap filled with sand, were
placed under the keel and over the dynamite to act as a
cushion and reduce the shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the wires were connected, and the three divers went
aboard the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>They removed their diving suits, and Frank faced Clifford
and Hartley, who were pale and somewhat excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now that the critical moment had come, each really
shrank from the mighty risk. Yet neither could justly be
called a coward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” said Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well!” exclaimed Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then there was a period of silence. Frank looked keenly
at the two men.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What shall it be?” he asked. “I shall leave it all with
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do not hesitate on our account,” said Hartley firmly;
“we do not shrink from it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All will be over in a very few moments. We shall know
if it is to be life or death.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be death in the long run anyway,” declared
Clifford. “Whatever it is, let us all meet our fate like brave
men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That settles it,” declared Frank, “prepare for the
shock!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything movable aboard the boat was carefully secured.
Then Frank announced all in readiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a moment of suspense.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank stood by the vestibule door with the wire and electric
key in his hand. He closed his eyes and spasmodically
pressed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was all a matter of momentous doubt. All hinged upon
the result of the explosion. Five human lives hung in the
balance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was instantaneous.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that the voyagers could ever remember of the affair
afterward was that there was a terrific shock, a confused
jumbling of ideas and incidents, and then——</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., opened his eyes and looked about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wonder of wonders!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was broad daylight.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were on the surface of the sea. All about them was
one heaving expanse of blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great whales!” cried Captain Hartley. “What sort of a
transformation do you call this, mates?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“We are saved!” cried Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s on the surface we are,” averred Barney.
“Howiver did this happen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh! Don’ yo’ know, I’ish?” cried Pomp. “Yo’ done
lef de switch ob de reservoir turned on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers that’s thrue!” cried the Celt. “I shure fergot
it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s all right!” cried Frank; “it helped the explosion to
raise the boat. Now it is only a question as to whether the
boat leaks or not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How shall we find out?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will sink if she does,” laughed Frank; “but I think
we could hear the water coming in if such was the case.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With which Frank went below. He listened at the bulkheads
leading into the hold.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the boat seemed as buoyant as ever. There was not
the slightest indication that she was leaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirits of all now waxed more cheerful. It was a
moral certainty that the boat was saved and their lives as
well.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as this realization fully dawned upon them, a loud
cry came from Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hi, dar! luk out or we be run down, Marse Frank!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VI' class='c010'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>PARKER’S DEEP GAME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>So engrossed had all been in the question of saving the
Dolphin that they were unconscious of other things transpiring
near them.</p>

<p class='c000'>All unnoticed, a full-rigged ship had come bearing down
upon them from the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been not a half mile distant when they came to the
surface, but they had not looked in that direction or noticed
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now not fifty yards from the Dolphin and bearing
directly down upon the submarine boat. It looked as if there
was a deliberate purpose to run the boat down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade sprung into the pilot-house and switched the
propeller valve, at the same moment turning the rudder
sharp about.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engines responded instantly and the Dolphin
switched about, not an instant too soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The big ship’s hull just grazed her stern. It was certainly
a very close call.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Indignantly Frank threw open the pilot-house window
and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy, there, do you mean to run us down?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Only a mumbling reply came back as the ship went on.
Men were seen in her chains and at her after rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ship lay over to the wind and showed her stern. Instinctively
all looked for the name.</p>

<p class='c000'>And before this could be seen, Captain Hartley, who had
been staring at the vessel, cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Soul of old Neptune! It is the Aurelian, mates!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The announcement was like a dynamite bomb to the
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Aurelian!” gasped Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you sure of it?” cried Frank, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course I am; don’t you suppose I would know my
own ship in any part of the world?” cried Hartley, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You ought to,” agreed Frank, “and your assertion is
proved, for there is the name!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was true.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the stern of the passing vessel was the name
“Aurelian.” That she was Gilbert Parker’s ship was a dead
certainty.</p>

<p class='c000'>That she had meant to run the submarine boat down was
also a sure thing. It was an atrocious purpose, and made
Frank’s blood boil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The mean wretch!” he cried, angrily, “he certainly
meant to run us down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That he did!” cried Hartley; “that is just like old
Parker.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They discussed the matter, angrily. The Aurelian was already
half a mile away.</p>

<p class='c000'>That she meant to recover the Veneta’s treasure if possible
before the Dolphin was a certainty. The thought angered
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see the whole cowardly game!” he cried angrily. “And
they shall pay for it well. They shall never carry home one
penny of the Veneta’s gold!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what could we do against them?” asked Hartley;
“their ship is larger than ours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You forget,” replied Frank, “the torpedo boat is the
most deadly craft in the U.S. navy. We can attack her on
the same scale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right,” cried the captain. “We surely need fear
nothing from her. We could sail under her if we chose and
sink her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just so,” said Frank. “At least I will give them a good
lesson.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang into the pilot-house. He was about to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>chase to the Aurelian, when a warning cry came from Barney,
who had just come up from the engine-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor,” he said, “there’s bad luck to pay!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?” asked Frank in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The tank, sor, is out of order. Shure, it must have been
the shock av dynamite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The tank!” exclaimed Frank, and sprung to the key
board. He pressed the pneumatic key. It would not operate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boat remained upon the surface. Barney was right.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tank was certainly out of order. But what was the
cause of it? Was it the result of the explosion?</p>

<p class='c000'>He reckoned that this was true. He went down into the
hold and made a quick examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>This showed him that the tank had shifted its position,
and bent the tubes so that water could not be pressed
through them. Until these were straightened there was no
hope of controlling the boat under water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank studied the situation for some time.</p>

<p class='c000'>He realized that it was an unfortunate situation, and that
unless the matter was remedied the expedition must prove a
failure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just how much of a job it would be to repair the damage
he could hardly estimate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Frank,” cried Clifford, “what do you think of it?
Is it an irreparable matter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied the young inventor, slowly; “yet, to tell the
truth, she ought to go into the dry dock. The tank should
be moved back and properly stayed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it impossible to do that without going into the dry
dock?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the game is up?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not yet,” said Frank, hopefully, “there is a chance, I
think we can readjust and straighten the tubes. If so, then
we shall be all right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that will delay us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For how long?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A day!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a dubious silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the Aurelian will reach the Gulf of Honduras
first. Perhaps she may even recover the treasure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let her, if she can,” said Frank, “it will not be such an
easy matter for her. She will have to send down divers and
make many preparations which will take up time. We will
get there about as soon as she does, I think.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Work was at once begun upon the twisted tubes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp brought all the necessary tools down
into the place and operations commenced.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>As they progressed, Frank found that the job was not to
be as difficult as he had imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tubes were uncoupled and straightened, and the
valves readjusted. But it required fourteen hours of hard
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meanwhile the Aurelian was long out of sight
and well on her way into the Gulf of Honduras. She must
surely reach the sunken galleon before the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fate seems to play a very important hand in this matter,”
said Clifford. “With all our accidents it is a wonder
that we are able to reach Honduras at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is true,” agreed Frank, “but let us hope that we
shall meet with no more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Amen!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The tank was now once more in working order. In other
respects the Dolphin was all right.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once again she set out for the continuance of her voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Darkness was now over the sea. Yet the submarine boat,
with her powerful searchlight was enabled to make fully as
good time as in daylight.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the afternoon of the next day that Frank announced
that they had passed through the Yucatan Channel
and were really in the Gulf of Honduras.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once more the diagram as prepared from memory by
Clifford was consulted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sailing by this for hours the Dolphin kept on.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evening when they reached the locality where the
Donna Veneta was supposed to have sunk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the spot as near as I can locate it,” said Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If that is true,” said Frank, “we have outwitted Parker,
for the Aurelian is certainly not in this vicinity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was true that no vessel was in sight. The Aurelian
must have gone upon the wrong tack.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will we do?” asked Captain Hartley; “shall we
wait until morning, or attempt to explore the ocean by electric
light?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Even in daylight we should have to use the searchlight,”
said Clifford eagerly. “Suppose we examine it now, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” agreed the young inventor. “All is ready
for the descent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The doors and windows were quickly and hermetically
closed. Then the Dolphin plunged beneath the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down she went for several hundred fathoms before the
bottom was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a sandy plain lay before them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is good!” cried Frank. “It will be easier to find
the Donna Veneta than if the bottom was covered with
weeds.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“True,” agreed Clifford. “I hope we will not be long in
discovering her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All hands now posted themselves at the windows. The
searchlight flashed everywhere across the sandy plain, while
the boat moved slowly about in the quest.</p>

<p class='c000'>All manner of curious objects were encountered. Sometimes
a huge projecting ledge of rock would be mistaken
for the wreck.</p>

<p class='c000'>And thus the search went on slowly and systematically.
Results were not far distant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>A PARLEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For the rest of the night the quest was kept up. It was
morning before anything worthy of note was discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank in the pilot-house flashing the light into the
far depths gave a sudden start.</p>

<p class='c000'>The object which met his gaze was certainly one well
worthy of attention and interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw several forms groping about at the base of a small
reef. He knew at once from their shape that they were not
marine animals.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On my word!” he cried, “here’s a go!”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment Clifford and Hartley were by his side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?” cried the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank pointed to the distant objects. A startled exclamation
burst from the lips of both men.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well I’m beat!” gasped Clifford; “they are human beings.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divers!” exclaimed Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing more nor less,” said Frank. “It is quite likely
that the Aurelian is just overhead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is the whole story!” cried Clifford. “They are
looking for the Donna Veneta.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank put on more speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” he said shortly, “let us run down and interview
them!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Correct,” said Clifford. “We will ask a bit of an explanation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The divers were apparently astonished at the sudden radiance
of the searchlight. They stood in a group waiting for
developments.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the submarine boat came rushing down they seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>alarmed, but Frank showed himself at the pilot-house windows,
and made conciliatory gestures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The submarine boat came to a halt not ten yards from the
divers. No sign of the Donna Veneta’s wreck was visible
anywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get on a diving suit, Barney!” cried Frank. “Go out
and ask them what they are doing here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney hastened to obey orders. But before he could leave
the boat, the divers gave the signal and were pulled up rapidly
to the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank instantly reversed the tank lever. The Dolphin
began to rise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are you going, Frank?” asked Clifford in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To the surface!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to see whether these men are from the Aurelian
or not.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin sprung up out of the deep sea. All was daylight
and the sun was well up toward the meridian.</p>

<p class='c000'>A vessel lay to not one hundred yards distant. There were
a group of men leaning over her rail and apparently hauling
up something on lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>These, of course, were the divers. A moment later they
were pulled safely over the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank instantly sailed nearer the Aurelian, for she it was,
and made signals.</p>

<p class='c000'>In response a man appeared in the shrouds. He was at
once recognized. It was Gilbert Parker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is the old chap himself!” cried Cecil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us see what he has to say,” said Frank, as he stepped
out on the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was but a moment’s work to answer the hail of Parker.
The latter’s words were pitched in a snarling key.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We want to have a talk with you!” cried Frank. “Come
over in a small boat. You will be safe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have no business that I wish to transact with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but it may be to your interest to talk with us,” returned
Frank. “You had better grant us an interview.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A snarling, unintelligible reply came back. Then a boat
put out from the Aurelian’s side and was rowed swiftly
alongside the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gilbert Parker and a dark-browed man stood in the bow.
They stepped out on the Dolphin’s deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Captain Warren,” said Parker, with a peculiar smile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>as he exchanged salutes and introduced his companion, “he
is the present sailing master of the Aurelian.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he turned abruptly to Frank and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gazed keenly at the old rascal for a moment, and
then replied with deliberation:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are in search of the sunken galleon Donna Veneta.
What are you here for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Parker’s gaze shifted, but he managed to make reply:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are here for the same purpose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think your course has been an honorable one?”
asked Frank cuttingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To the victor belongs the spoils!” was the evasive but
bold reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did you know where to look for the galleon?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did I not see the diagram?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did you not steal it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean to insult me?” snapped Parker, angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I mean to speak plainly and truthfully to you,” said
Frank firmly; “the diagram disappeared that very night
that it was shown to you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very substantial evidence of my guilt,” sneered Parker;
“did any one see me take it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It matters not whether any one saw you take it or not,”
declared Frank, “the fact remains that you knew where to
look for the sunken galleon, and you could not have done so
without some means of guidance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Parker grinned impudently.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” he said, “have I not as good a right to the gold as
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied Frank, “the gold belongs rightfully to Mr.
Clifford, who discovered the records of its existence. You
prove yourself a thief by your underhand methods in trying
to get it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You dare to call me a thief?” cried Parker hotly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are worse than a thief! You are capable of any
crime!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something in Frank’s steely eye held the villain at bay.
He glared at him madly for some moments, and then said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not intend that anybody else shall recover that
treasure. I have come down into these waters for it and I
intend to find it. If you interfere with me I shall blow you
into atoms. You may take the warning!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Really,” said Frank, with a smile. “You are quite a
bully, Mr. Parker. Be sure of your strength before you venture
to make threats. As for the Donna Veneta’s gold it is
not a certainty that it can ever be found or recovered by
either of us. However, if it is found we shall claim it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>right of Mr. Clifford’s just claim, and you will not dare to
deny it. Let this terminate the interview. Good-day!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank turned on his heel and went into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Parker stood a moment the personification of rage and
hatred. Then he shook his fist at Frank’s retreating form,
and hissed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall see! Gilbert Parker never fails. Beware!”</p>

<p class='c000'>With which he turned and stepped into his own boat. He
was rowed back to the Aurelian.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, in the pilot-house, closed the doors, and then
pressed the lever which caused the Dolphin to sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down she settled rapidly until finally she rested upon the
sandy bottom of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” he said, “we will proceed to search for the Donna
Veneta.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it is our good fortune to find the galleon’s gold, is
there not danger that we may have trouble with Parker?”
asked Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t see how he can trouble us!” said Frank. “We
are out of his way and can keep so. If I were so inclined I
could sink his ship now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would be a mercy!” declared Hartley. “I have no
grudge against the ship. It is only the owner!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait!” said Frank decidedly. “You will see that his
fate will yet overtake him. I have never seen it fail. Rascality
is bound to meet its just reward!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Preparations were made for renewing the search for the
galleon.</p>

<p class='c000'>As full two hundred years had elapsed since she had gone
to the bottom, it was likely that she was buried somewhat
in the sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>This drifting for two centuries over her hull might indeed
have completely covered her up.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only way, therefore, to make sure of her discovery
was to search for some part of her rigging or hull, which
might yet project itself above the sand, or at least the finding
of some object which might guide them as to her exact
location.</p>

<p class='c000'>To be sure this seemed somewhat like looking for a needle
in a haystack, but yet the search was carried on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Clifford were selected to accompany Frank.
Pomp and Hartley were to manipulate the searchlight
aboard the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>And thus the quest, began.</p>

<p class='c000'>Donning their diving suits, the three searchers left the
Dolphin. They made their way over the sandy floor armed
with spades.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a close and careful search which they proceeded to</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>And after wandering some distance from the Dolphin,
Frank made the first important discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw an object wedged in a projecting spur of coral.
He extricated and examined it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the rusted hilt of a sword. But little was left of the
ivory grip, but the steel and gold frame was intact.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an instant Barney and Clifford were by his side.</p>

<p class='c000'>They placed their helmets together and Clifford shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have made a discovery of value, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I think I have,” replied the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps the ship is right under us at this moment?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think it would be well to dig down a bit and see what
is beneath us,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurro! Here goes thin!” cried Barney, thrusting his
spade into the sand. He turned up a spadeful.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then his spade struck something solid. An object was
brought to view. It was stationary.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?” asked Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank bent down and examined it. Then he arose and
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the stump of a ship’s mast. On my word, friends,
I believe the galleon lies buried beneath us.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c010'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A DIVERS’ BATTLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Barney cut a caper in the sand, and Clifford fairly embraced
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” he cried. “Success is bound to be ours!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It looks like it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the galleon is under us we have only to dig down to
her deck level, and then find our way into her cabin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just so!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How is the sand?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Judging from the size of the mast and the point at
which she is broken off, I should say not more than four or
five feet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, it will take no time to dig down that far.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It ought not to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here goes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having a spade also, Clifford began to dig with Barney.
In a very few moments the blades struck something solid.
The sand was scraped away, and boards were revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ship’s deck!” cried Clifford, half insane with glee.
“Hurrah! Now we have hit it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Quickly they cleared a space of several feet. To the surprise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>of all the timbers seemed as well preserved and sound
as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is remarkable!” cried Frank, “after a lapse of two
centuries. There must be some preservative element in the
water here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed I thought of that myself,” declared Clifford,
“it seems to be more buoyant and of a different quality from
ordinary sea water. And there is a peculiar substance in the
sand which is uncommon!”</p>

<p class='c000'>An effort would have been at once made to cut a section
of the deck away had it not been for an incident quite unforeseen.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were just at the angle of quite a high reef.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around this suddenly five men appeared in diving suits
with ropes and life lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were the Aurelian divers. Each one carried a heavy
ax and a spade. They paused at sight of the three divers
from the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment not a move was made by either party. Then
Clifford leaned forward and shouted to Frank:</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are Parker’s men!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you think their game is? Will they trouble
us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure of it, if they think we have discovered the galleon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They must know that we have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look! They are menacing us! What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is but one thing to do,” declared Frank, grittily.
“We must defend ourselves at all hazards!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The five divers from the Aurelian were handicapped
somewhat more than their rivals on account of the life lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this did not deter them from making a threatening
move just the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>They advanced with excited gestures. The foremost,
Frank fancied, was Parker himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor was not a little disturbed as to what
the outcome of the affair would be.</p>

<p class='c000'>If blows were resorted to, then there must be loss of life.
This was something which Frank always deprecated.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could not endure the thought of destroying these men,
though they meant to destroy him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an easy matter to cut their life lines and terminate
their existence in a brief moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet the horror of the thing held him enthralled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The divers advanced threateningly, evidently confident
that they could drive away the three men with their superior</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>But this was not so easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and his companions stood side by side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do not strike unless we are really attacked,” he declared,
“then do not take their lives if you can help it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The foremost of the Aurelian’s men made a dive at Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor struck the fellow over the helmet
with the flat end of his spade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shock laid him out senseless; but another followed
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>This one struck Clifford to his knees. But Barney went
to the rescue and saved the explorer’s life.</p>

<p class='c000'>A quick blow from the Celt’s spade dashed the diver over
senseless. The other three drew back.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now even up. Barney was spoiling for a fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook his spade and rushed toward the three divers.
But at that moment one of them apparently became terrified
and pulled on the danger line.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an instant they were twirled upward and out of sight.
The insensible ones also went.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment our divers stood spellbound. Then they
placed their helmets together, and Clifford shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah! a victory for us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They evidently got more than they bargained for,” said
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s a moighty lucky thing fer them that they
went!” cried Barney. “Shure I wud soon have laid thim all
out, the spalpeens!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They certainly were not overwell gifted with pluck,”
agreed Frank. “But I am sure that we are not done with
them yet!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So am I,” agreed Clifford; “old Parker is a literal
bloodhound. He will never leave a scent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, let thim cum again if they want to!” cried
Barney. “Shure, I’m in fer thryin’ to get into the buried
ship again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s right!” cried Frank. “We must not abandon that
scheme. Let us be at work!”</p>

<p class='c000'>They picked up their spades and once more set heartily
at work.</p>

<p class='c000'>So swiftly did Barney and Clifford throw sand that it was
not long before a large space on the galleon’s deck had been
cleared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a closed hatch was revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney put his spade under it and quickly pried it open.
Some stairs descended into the cabin below.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank placed his helmet against Clifford’s and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will descend first. It will be better for only one of us
to explore the galleon at a time. The Aurelian’s men may
return at any time.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Clifford saw the justice of this, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right. We will hold guard here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank put a foot on the cabin stairs. He descended quickly
and entered the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he did so, he came to a startled halt in the center of
the cabin. What followed was ever after to him like a
hideous nightmare.</p>

<p class='c000'>The electric globe on his helmet lit up everything in the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in its sickening glare the scene which was enacted
was enough to freeze the blood in the veins of any ordinary
man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My soul!” he gasped, and threw up his arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>From every corner of the cabin there rushed toward him
ghastly stiffened human bodies, corpses of men who had
been dead for two centuries. Could he believe his senses?</p>

<p class='c000'>The agitation he created in the water of the pent-up cabin
caused the bodies to fly toward him like steel particles toward
a magnet. He put up his hands to ward them off.</p>

<p class='c000'>In every conceivable and distorted shape were the ghastly
occupants of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>There they were, hideous in death, savage-looking men,
cutthroats and scoundrels of the past two centuries. But
how was it that they were not dust long ago?</p>

<p class='c000'>How was it that they had been so well preserved? Was it
the action of the water, or the fact that they had for so long
been closed up in that cabin?</p>

<p class='c000'>One old fellow in a gold-laced coat and with long, flowing
hair and beard came rushing toward Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even as the young inventor pushed him aside the
coat crumbled and one arm dropped away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The influx of fresh water from above was beginning to
tell.</p>

<p class='c000'>It could be easily seen that the preservation of the bodies
for such a wonderful period of time was due wholly to a certain
element in the water, and the fact that they had been
closely bottled up in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>These men had, two centuries before, sailed the waters of
the Honduras Gulf and left their homes in sunny Spain to
seek an El Dorado in the New World.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this had been their end. It was a wonderful thing to
ponder upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank stood spellbound.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the ghastly forms, contorted and twisted into every
possible shape, went sailing about the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of them had already begun to fall into dissolution.
The ultimate end of all was assured.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank soon regained his composure.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>His momentary dread of the corpses passed away, and he
now bethought himself of looking for the galleon’s hidden
gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>That this was really the Donna Veneta he felt assured.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some moments he steeled his nerves and essayed to
cross the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Horrors!</p>

<p class='c000'>The hideous corpses came rushing about him, striking
him and brushing by in unwelcome contact.</p>

<p class='c000'>For an instant, overcome with the horror of the moment,
Frank struck out right and left fighting the corpses
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus he had made his way half across the cabin floor
when a strange thing happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a sudden terrific shock, he was hurled upon his
face, and for a few seconds was stunned.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came to he regained his feet and started for the
cabin stairs. His one thought was that something terrible
had happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>To find out what this was from Barney and Clifford was
his first purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprung up the stairs, but came to a sudden halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>His progress was barred. His head struck the hatch
above. It was closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment Frank was astounded. Then he essayed to
lift the hatch.</p>

<p class='c000'>He pressed his weight against it time and again. But
each time it refused to yield.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IX' class='c010'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE GALLEON’S GOLD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>What did it mean?</p>

<p class='c000'>He tried to clear his befogged mind and think clearly on
the subject, but the result was that he was always more perplexed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He pounded on the hatch, and would have shouted to
Barney and Clifford had he been sure that they would hear
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they were still outside, they certainly must be aware
that the hatch was closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why, then, did they not lift it? Why should they for so
long allow it to remain closed?</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a chilling thought came to Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gasped and sank down upon the cabin stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“My soul! Can it be possible?” he muttered. “Am I
buried alive?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He remembered the explosion or shock which had flung
him upon his face!</p>

<p class='c000'>What did it mean?</p>

<p class='c000'>Had something happened above to seal the fate of his
friends as well as his own? Yet he could not imagine what
that happening could be.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will not believe it,” he muttered. “I will wait. They
will yet come to my rescue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Time passed slowly enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the rescue did not come.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, Frank did not give up hope, and fresh interest
was aroused in his mind in the galleon’s gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why waste my time,” he thought, “if anything has happened
they will dig me out in good time. I am not afraid
of that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With which consoling reflection he set out to find the galleon’s
gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once more he started across the cabin floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gained a door on the opposite side and pushed against
it. It opened and he walked in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the hideous corpses attacked him. But he heeded
them not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into a second cabin he passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>One happy state of affairs he noticed. There were no dead
bodies in the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evidently the captain’s cabin; everything was in a
remarkable state of preservation.</p>

<p class='c000'>He passed along to the captain’s table. The sextant,
quadrant box, compass and globe were yet there; but the
charts and maps and all papers had dissolved.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was to be regretted, as the true history of the Donna
Veneta might never be known.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank was looking for the galleon’s gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>He opened the doors of the desk; they were filled with
miscellaneous articles. There were a few gold and silver
coins and a number of jewels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank passed on from the captain’s cabin into the forward
cabin. This was also deserted. But everything in the place
seemed in a perfect state of preservation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor did not waste much time here.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked curiously at some articles of bric-a-brac which
had withstood the rack of time. Some of them were of value,
and he decided to have them removed to the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>So interested did he become in his research that he became
quite oblivious of the fact that he was imprisoned alive
in a sunken ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond this cabin there was the forecastle. This contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>no material of value, but the seamen’s chests were in
some cases open and the contents thrown carelessly about,
just as their owners had left them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank spent but little time in the forecastle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he went below into the hold. Here were the stores
which the Spaniards had placed aboard the Veneta for her
long cruise.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were casks of wine, rich old Madeira, of priceless
value now, could it be brought to the light of day. Great
barrels of pork and ship biscuits, and other matters too numerous
for specific mention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the hold Frank went to the magazine. Here was
a goodly store of powder and ball. Next was the gun-room,
with many stands of small arms of the ancient firelock pattern.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” muttered the young inventor, after all this,
“where is the princely fortune of gold which is supposed to
be contained in this vessel? Surely it must be hid away in
some secret part of the ship, if it exists at all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet he saw no reasons for doubting its existence. He
remembered that the treasure rooms aboard these old galleons
were generally secret chambers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that case he must look for such; with which recollection
he began examining the partitions and bulkheads.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed more logical to him that the treasure chamber
should be contiguous to the captain’s room.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he went thither.</p>

<p class='c000'>And examining the wainscoting thoroughly, he found
that there existed quite a large space between that and the
main cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see,” he muttered; “this is where the treasure room is
located. But now how can entrance to it be obtained?”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a question, but Frank fell to closely searching
the surface of the wainscoting.</p>

<p class='c000'>This had a speedy result.</p>

<p class='c000'>He discovered a slender crack which he felt sure outlined
a door. He followed it with his finger until he came to a
tiny button set in the wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this he pressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was quickly apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>A section of the wainscoting moved back. Time had not
affected the locks and springs.</p>

<p class='c000'>A square chamber was revealed beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank flashed his electric light into it. Then he entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The treasure chamber was about eight by ten feet square,
but it was half filled with metal chests piled one upon the
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were all locked, and resisted the strongest efforts
of the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>But they were extremely heavy, and he doubted not but
that they contained gold or silver coin.</p>

<p class='c000'>That this was the treasure chamber of the vessel he made
sure by the discovery of a rude reckoning in Spanish
scratched upon a brass tablet with a bodkin of steel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each chest had one of these plates affixed to it, and they
announced the contents of each in pesos.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank counted the chests, and making an average, estimated
the fortune at the enormous sum of two million dollars.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What will Clifford and Hartley say?” he thought;
“surely it will be a surprise to them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a chill struck him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He remembered his position and the peculiar shock which
he had experienced some while before.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder if they have got the hatch open yet?” he
mused.</p>

<p class='c000'>With which reflection he decided to go back and see. Accordingly
he opened the door to the main cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as he did so he shivered at the ordeal before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were the hideous array of corpses yet swinging
round the circle. They grinned at him in a fiendish way,
and then made a dash at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, in spite of himself, gave a shriek and slammed the
door after him. Then he hurled the frightful cadavers from
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of them had melted away into ashes upon the cabin
floor, but others seemed to hold their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ugh!” muttered the young inventor. “I can’t say that
I like this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>However, he made his way across the cabin to the stairway.
Up this he clambered.</p>

<p class='c000'>He put his hand up. The hatch was still down.</p>

<p class='c000'>He tried to force it upward.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would not yield.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment a stunned feeling came over Frank. He
sank down upon the stairs and an awful reflection came over
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have deserted me!” he muttered. “My God, they
have left me to die!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Imprisoned forever in that sunken vessel with the corpses
of two hundred years ago for companions!</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly it was an awful situation. What could he do?</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., was a brave young man. But in spite
of this he was almost unnerved by the reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temptation was strong upon him to end the affair
then and there. Why make the end a lingering one?</p>

<p class='c000'>All sorts of tragic fancies forced themselves upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Dead to the world, buried alive, destined never to see
God’s sunlight and beautiful day again.</p>

<p class='c000'>What a horrible thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his very agony of spirit he wailed:</p>

<p class='c000'>“God help me! Is there no chance for my life? Can I
not find my way out of here in some way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he became calmer. Never were his inventive faculties
keener. A sort of desperation was upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will find a way out!” he muttered resolutely.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew his ax from his belt and began work upon the
hatch. But it was of toughest oak and seemed to yield but a
little to the keen blade.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='X' class='c010'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>WHAT BECAME OF THE DOLPHIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But what of the others?</p>

<p class='c000'>What had happened?</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Clifford were holding vigil at the opening to
the hatchway. They were waiting eagerly for word from
Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of a sudden there was a blinding flash of brightest
light, an awful roar and a shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both men were lifted as if by a catapult and whirled
away in surging masses of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had instinctive sense enough to cling to each other
through all.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed an interminable length of time that they were
tossed and hurled and carried through the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they sank and once more felt the bed of the ocean
beneath them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They lay upon the sands for some little while.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the water grew calm about them and they recovered
themselves. They sat up and looked about.</p>

<p class='c000'>The locality did not greatly differ from the one they had
left.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the same expanse of sand and coral reef.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their helmet lights made a limited circle of radiance
about them. Beyond that all was darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” exclaimed Clifford, placing his helmet against
Barney’s, “what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Shure, sor; it beats me. I’m afther thinkin’ somethin’
blew up!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes, there was an explosion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what was it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m sthuck, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Could it have been the Dolphin?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney shook his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll niver believe that, sor. No, it’s my opinion that
thim omadhouns av the Aurelian had the insthrumentality
av it all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford gave a start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have it!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Phwat, sor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the work of Parker. He dropped a torpedo down
upon us. It’s a wonder that it did not kill us. If his aim
had been true we should now be dead!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt looked his horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, an’ phwat av it sthruck the Dolphin?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not think it fell in that locality,” declared Clifford,
“though I have no doubt the Dolphin felt the shock somewhat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Barney gave a wild start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, shure, sor, it’s fools we are to be here an’ leave Misther
Frank phwere he is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is right,” agreed Clifford. “We must go and look
for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With which they got upon their feet and looked about
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing was to be seen of the Dolphin or her searchlight.
All was gloom about them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But beyond the circle of their helmet lamps Clifford saw a
white reef.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The sunken galleon is on the other side of that,” he
said; “the shock of the explosion carried us over here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sor!” cried Barney, with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c000'>So they set out for the reef. Below was a sandy plain, and
they fancied they could see the excavation over the galleon’s
deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when they reached the spot it was not there. Nor was
there anything at all familiar in the surroundings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” muttered Clifford. “I can’t say that I like this.
Let us look on further.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>And this they proceeded to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>From one spot to another they wandered. But each grew
less familiar and the more strongly impressed the fact upon
them that they were lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hundreds of fathoms from the surface in very mid-ocean.
What an awful reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>It held the two men aghast. Nothing but despair and
death hung over them like a grim pall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile what of the Dolphin and Pomp and Hartley?</p>

<p class='c000'>At the moment that the torpedo exploded Pomp was adjusting
the searchlight, and Hartley was watching the operations
of his friends in digging for the galleon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have found it, Pomp!” he cried; “and Frank has
gone down into it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! I done hope nuffin happen to him down dere!”
cried the coon. “I’se drefful afeared ob gittin’ in some place
laike dat whar yo’ never kin git out!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I share your fears, Pomp,” said Hartley. “Yet we must
admit that Frank knows his business well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ suah, sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The words were barely out of Pomp’s lips when he saw a
distant object come sliding down through the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ ‘am dat?” he muttered, but said no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>The instant the object touched the bed of the sea, there
was a fearful, blinding flash, an awful boom and shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then all was chaos and oblivion for a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was picked up as if it was a bubble, and
hurled through the waters most violently.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed as if it would never cease whirling, when there
was a crash and a shock. Then Pomp found himself standing
on his head in a corner of the cabin, and Hartley was
jammed into another corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was some moments before either recovered breath
enough to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then suddenly the electric lights were paled by the light
of day. Both glanced through the windows and saw that
they were on the surface of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Aurelian was seen some distance away.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jemina!” exclaimed Hartley as he gained his feet,
“what on earth happened to us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, dat am jes’ wha’ I was finkin’!” cried Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, rubbing their bruises, they looked about to see what
harm had been done.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>But the boat was apparently uninjured, and floated lightly
on the rolling waves.</p>

<p class='c000'>But certainly something had happened to bring the boat
to the surface in such a startling manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>What this was Hartley tried to think. Then all came to
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the north star!” he cried, “that was a torpedo those
rascals exploded, thinking to annihilate us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A torpedo!” exclaimed Pomp. “Den it am berry lucky
dat we was not blowed up!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed it was!” exclaimed Hartley. “I wish I had a
gun; I’d sink their infernal craft!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hi, dar—look out!” yelled Pomp. “Dey hab got a gun
fo’ suah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A puff of smoke leaped from the side of the Aurelian.
There was a distant boom, and a shot passed not a foot
above the vessel’s rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aim was not so close as it would be next time, and
Hartley knew it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out, Pomp!” he cried, “they mean to sink us!
Send her to the bottom again!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, dat am jes’ wha’ I will do!” cried the darky.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprung to the keyboard. He swung the tank lever
about. But the boat did not sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky was astounded. A shade of dismay crept across
his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de lan’s sake!” he muttered. “Wha’ am de mattah?
Am anyfing bruk?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mercy on us!” cried Hartley; “don’t say that, Pomp!
What will become of Frank and the others?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a fearful reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boom!</p>

<p class='c000'>Another shot came within an inch of taking away the
bow of the submarine boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are a set of pirates and murderers!” cried Hartley
angrily; “show them no mercy!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Massy Lordy! It don’ look as if we was gwine fo’ to hab
de chance!” declared the coon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, don’t expose the boat any longer to the shots. We
must at least get out of here!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ am right, sah! Yer goes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The coon put on speed and sped beyond range of the Aurelian’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>gun. Then Pomp applied himself to the all-important
matter of repairing the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was not as thorough a mechanic as Barney, yet he
knew something of the mechanism of the Dolphin. He
worked zealously.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found eventually that the shock had dislodged a piece
of steel plating in the bulkhead, which had fallen into the
cogs of the tank trucks and so obstructed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>To remove this was a matter of no little effort and time.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required six hours of active work to put the damaged
trucks back into good shape.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this while the Aurelian had been sending down divers
as Hartley saw through his glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether they had discovered the treasure or not was a
question.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they had, then there must have been some sort of an
encounter, and Pomp and Hartley feared for the safety of
their friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp worked like a Trojan to get the boat into working
order again, for he knew the importance of at once going
to the rescue of the lost ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of a sudden the Aurelian seemed to be pulling up anchor
and getting ready to sail away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cause of this move was for a time a mystery to Pomp
and Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the captain chanced to glance at the horizon, and
cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“On my word, mate, I see the reason for it. Look yonder!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Up from the southern horizon great masses of yellow
clouds were piling up.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sky had a brassy look, and the sea was lead-like.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A storm, sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes!” cried the captain; “it is a storm coming up, and
they mean to shift their position. Probably they will run for
the protection of some cay near here. There is one on the
western sea line. It is, I think, Miller’s Cay.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat am berry funny!” muttered Pomp, shaking his
head; “but it gibs us a good chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right! How is the tank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A’right now, sah! I done fink we can go to the bottom
berry quick, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Pomp closed the doors, and then went into the pilot-house.
He pressed the tank lever.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once the boat began to sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down she went steadily, and Pomp, flashing the searchlight,
finally saw the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the sea the Dolphin had nothing to fear from the
hurricane. This was her advantage over the Aurelian.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now in order to find the missing men of the crew.
What their fate was could only be guessed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Pomp sent the submarine boat forward at full speed.
In a very few moments she was in the vicinity of the spot
from which she had been driven by the explosion of the
bomb.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the exact location did not seem easy to find.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat am berry funny!” declared Pomp, after cruising
aimlessly about for awhile. “Wherebber can dey hab bin?
Whar am dat sunken ship?”</p>

<p class='c000'>A sharp spasmodic cry suddenly escaped Hartley’s lips
and he said hoarsely:</p>

<p class='c000'>“My soul! Look yonder. What is that?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XI' class='c010'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>FRANK’S ADVENTURES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Frank Reade, Jr., left in the cabin of the sunken galleon
was certainly in a position which it is hardly possible
for one to adequately realize.</p>

<p class='c000'>All hope seemed lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>The failure of his friends to return or open the hatch had
satisfied him that their fate was sealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>His one aim now was to get out of the galleon’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he rained blow after blow with his ax upon the closed
hatch. But it seemed obdurate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above one layer of planks was another.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was discouraging.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet he kept on and after a long period of fatiguing work
actually succeeded in cutting a hole through the hatch.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as he did so his ax sunk into some substance which
moved and fell in some quantity. It was sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mercy!” muttered the despair-stricken man, “it is true
that the sand has again covered the deck up.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>In this event his efforts to dig his way out would be futile.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was aweary and exhausted. In fact, he had barely
strength enough left to creep down the ladder.</p>

<p class='c000'>A strange drowsiness came over him. He could not resist
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He crept back to the captain’s cabin and sank down upon
a couch. Almost instantly he was asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>How long he slept he never knew.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he awoke he started up with a queer sense of his
surroundings. In a few moments, however, memory supplied
the blank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he looked about him in a hopeless way.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wondered if rescue had yet come, and arose to open
the door into the main cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he did so he was startled at an unexpected sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hatch was open and a man’s body was just sliding
down through it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Saved!” gasped the imprisoned man with a wild thrill.
Then he ceased to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stood like one overcome with horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On my word,” he finally managed to mutter, “fate has
played it into Parker’s hands after all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For it required no second glance for him to see that the
new-comer was one of the Aurelian’s crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peculiar fit of his diving suit and the life lines were
evidence of this.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment Frank knew not what to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should he face the new-comers and give them battle? He
could hardly hope to successfully meet such odds.</p>

<p class='c000'>What should he do?</p>

<p class='c000'>In lieu of a better move he stepped behind the captain’s
big desk. Through an orifice in the scrolled frame he could
see and not be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down into the main cabin came four of the Aurelian’s
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were held at bay for some moments by the ghostly
crew of the Veneta. But the love of gold overcame all their
scruples finally and they came across to the door of the captain’s
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>They stepped inside, and as Frank had done before them,
carefully examined everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately Frank had closed the door to the treasure
vault; they did not find this.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>But they came up to the captain’s desk and proceeded to
ransack it. Frank watched them intently.</p>

<p class='c000'>What should he do? In the very indecision of the moment
the divers from the Aurelian moved away.</p>

<p class='c000'>They passed from the captain’s cabin into the forward
cabin; for a moment Frank hesitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would have been an easy matter for him to have
reached out and cut the life lines of his foes.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he shrank from such an act of murder with repugnance.</p>

<p class='c000'>His one purpose was to reach the gangway and get out of
the hold of the vessel as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to him that his best move was to regain the
deck of the submarine boat and rejoin his friends as soon as
possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, when the divers had passed from the captain’s cabin
into the main cabin, he slipped out from his concealment
and started for the gangway.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fatal move!</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the Aurelian’s men turned just in time to see him.
Instantly the fellow raised his ax and hurled it at Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at close range, and the blunt head of it struck the
young inventor’s helmet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shock was sufficient to instantly deprive him of his
senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>He fell like a log.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment his captors were upon him. One of them
fiercely raised his ax to brain the defenseless man.</p>

<p class='c000'>But another caught his arm, and thrusting his helmet
against his, shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Avast there, Parker! Don’t kill him yet!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not, Warren? Let go of my arm! There is no reason
why I should spare his life!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, there is!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is likely that he can give us information in regard to
the galleon’s gold. At any rate do not kill him yet, messmate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Warren’s admonition had its effect upon Gilbert
Parker. The would-be murderer lowered his ax.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, Warren,” he said; “perhaps you’re right after
all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s body was lifted up and he was placed upon a rotting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>couch near. He was already regaining his consciousness.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at this moment Warren gave a start. He placed his
helmet to Parker’s and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A danger signal from above!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait until I can learn.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Warren was enabled to speak through his tube with those
on the Aurelian’s deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently he turned to Parker and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A hurricane is coming up. Mate Clark has already got
the anchor under way, and has recalled our boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we have got to give up the search for now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how can we escape the hurricane?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Make for Miller’s Cay, which is within sight of the
ship’s masthead. We can then return and reclaim the galleon’s
gold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The diving lines did not proceed from the Aurelian’s
deck, but from a small launch which was moored at some
little distance from the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>So when the crew of the Dolphin saw the Aurelian weigh
anchor the divers were not aboard her, nor did they get
aboard until some while later.</p>

<p class='c000'>A consultation was held as to what it was best to do with
their captive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take off his weights and take him aboard with us,” cried
Parker.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No!” objected Warren.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have a better plan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Leave him here. Batten down the hatches and let him
stay until we return. Bind him so that he cannot move!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Capital!” cried Parker. “We can decide what else to do
with him when we return!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This move decided upon, no time was lost in executing it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was quickly bound hand and foot. Then he was
left lying upon his back in the main cabin, with the floating
corpses all about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>His captors disappeared up the stairway and he was left
alone.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>He heard them batten down the hatch and cover it over
with sand. Then he groaned:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, my soul! I am truly lost. The end of this can only
be death.”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c000'>The sharp cry uttered by Hartley at the close of a preceding
chapter while he and Pomp were sailing blindly
about in the deep sea with the Dolphin was well warranted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Afar in the distance the captain saw a faint star of light.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not in the searchlight’s path, and consequently
easily seen. Pomp also saw it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Massy Lordy!” gasped Pomp. “Wha’ am it but de helmet
lamp ob some one ob our men!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must be!” cried Hartley hopefully, “it can be nothing
else.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ am right!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Turn the searchlight on to it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A sharp cry of joy burst from the lips of each. The distant
figure of a man was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” cried Hartley; “by the North Star if that
isn’t one of our men. We shall save him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! dat am good luck!” cried Pomp joyfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the turning of the searchlight full upon them that
had caused Barney and Clifford such a thrill of surprise as
was depicted at the close of a preceding chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the remote chance of a reunion was fully considered
this could be deemed nothing short of miraculous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The submarine voyagers certainly had good reason to
congratulate themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The submarine boat now bore down upon the two lost voyagers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank God, Barney, we are saved!” cried Clifford, joyfully;
“fate is with us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, we’ll be on deck yet, be the sowl av Pat Murphy!”
cried Barney. “Shure, it’s a bit av luck fer us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearer drew the submarine boat. In a short while it
loomed up near at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the two lost men clambered aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were quickly in the cabin, and were fairly embraced
by Pomp and Hartley.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mutual congratulations followed, and then all was fully
explained. After both stories were told, Barney cried:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Begorra, phwat do yez think has happened to Frank
Reade, Jr.?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, I done fink yo’ ought to know de mos’ about dat!”
cried Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl, we left him in the cabin av the sunken
ship!”</p>

<p class='c000'>All looked at each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then he must be there yet!” said Clifford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course,” agreed Hartley. “God grant no harm has
come to him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot see why it should,” said Clifford. “At least our
best move is to go right back there and find him. There is
no doubt but that we shall find him all right, unless——”</p>

<p class='c000'>The same thought crossed the minds of all in that moment.
They remembered the Aurelian’s men and the opportunity
they had.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they had come upon Frank and made him a prisoner,
there was no telling what the villain Parker might do with
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” cried Pomp, “if dey hab done Marse Frank any
harm dey bettah say dere prayers, fo’ dey will pay fo’ it as
suah as I is a bo’n niggah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is right, Pomp,” declared Clifford. “We are all
with you to a man. It shall be so. But we will continue to
hope that he is all right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yas, sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>At once preparations were made for resuming the search
for the sunken galleon.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not so very difficult to locate her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bearings were obtained and then the Dolphin sailed down
for the spot. As she drew nearer the reef nothing was seen
of the Aurelian’s divers.</p>

<p class='c000'>But traces of their visit were discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the sand there were spades and other tools left by
them. This would seem to be evidence that they meant to
return.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On me worrud as a gintleman,” cried Barney, “I belave
they’ve done harrum to Misther Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us hope we will find him in the galleon’s cabin,” said
Clifford. “Anchor the boat, boys.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was quickly set down and anchored. Then
lots were drawn to see who were to be the favored ones to
visit the galleon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>It fell to Hartley and Pomp. This seemed just enough, as
they had previously remained aboard the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” cried Clifford. “I find no fault. Only bring
Frank back with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! we done do dat if we can, yo’ bet,” cried the
darky.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments they had donned their diving suits and
left the Dolphin. They crossed the intervening distance to
the deck of the galleon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sand had been excavated, and the hatch was open.</p>

<p class='c000'>One moment the two explorers paused at the head of the
cabin stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Hartley said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Follow me, Pomp!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A’right, sah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Down the stairs they went. The sight which they met appalled
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The floating corpses was more than Pomp could stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there was one thing the darky had a horror of it was a
corpse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Massy Lordy!” he groaned; “de debbil am down dere
fo’ shuah! He done git dis chile!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nonsense!” cried Hartley, impatiently. “Come along,
you black rascal!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But no amount of persuasion could induce Pomp to enter
the dead men’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hartley gave up the task.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” he said, “I must go alone. Keep guard at the
hatchway, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do dat,” agreed Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down into the cabin Hartley went. He pushed the floating
bodies aside.</p>

<p class='c000'>He passed from one part of the ship to another. There
were marks of a former visit plain enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Someone had entered before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the object of his quest—Frank Reade, Jr.—could not
be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no trace of him to be found anywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was very mysterious.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the reader this will seem strange, as we left him securely
bound and the hatches closed by the departing divers
of the Aurelian.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Frank Reade, Jr., left bound hand and foot upon the
floor of the main cabin of the Donna Veneta, was in by no
means a happy frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was always clear grit and never given to despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet at that moment his case looked black and hopeless
enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lay for some while after the departure of his captors
without making a move of any kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other occupants of the cabin were respectful enough.
Occasionally one of the dead buccaneers would lazily change
his position, or, catching a current, float across the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>At such times the young inventor could not avoid a chill
of horror, so ghostly and supernatural did the buccaneers
look.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time elapsed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed an age to Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He speculated upon his chances in a methodical sort of
way and gave himself up to somewhat morbid reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, his worst fate could only be death. It must come
to him some time. Drowning was, after all, not the worst
form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the suicidal mania threatened him. Especially was
this the case when he reckoned the hopelessness of his position.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a time, however, reaction was bound to set in.</p>

<p class='c000'>Life never seemed to have a more rosy hue. It would seem
a transition into paradise to reach the upper world.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this came a desperate sort of hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Why not make a supreme effort?</p>

<p class='c000'>He could do no worse than fail. Once his mind was made
up there was no faltering.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began work on his bonds. He writhed and twisted for
some while. The water had swollen the ropes, but it had also
weakened the strands.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rolled over and over until he reached the door of the
captain’s cabin. Here his gaze fell upon an object which
gave him a thrill.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an ax.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>It had been dropped there by one of the divers. At once
Frank saw his opportunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rolled over to it in such a manner as to press his bonds
against its keen edge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again and again he pressed the cords against the keen
blade; one by one the strands snapped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally the last one was cut; Frank experienced a thrill.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest was easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had the use of his hands now, and with the blade of
the ax he cut the other bonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>He scrambled to his feet a free man; for a moment he was
undecided how to act.</p>

<p class='c000'>His impulse was to get out of the cabin of the galleon;
but how could this be done?</p>

<p class='c000'>The hatch had been battened down by the Aurelian’s
divers when they went away. Could he hope to break it
open? He could at least try.</p>

<p class='c000'>He ascended the stairs and dealt the hatch a blow. Joy!
it yielded, and with a great effort he forced it open.</p>

<p class='c000'>He pushed away the sand and emerged at last from the
prison he had occupied so long.</p>

<p class='c000'>He examined his generator.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were chemicals enough in it to last full forty-eight
hours longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps by that time they will return for me,” he reflected.
“At least I will cling to hope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no sign of the submarine boat or of the Aurelian’s
men in the vicinity. He was in a quandary as to what
to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>While in this state of doubt he wandered away from the
spot for some ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again a strange drowsiness came upon him. He could
not help but yield to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He waited for a time, fighting off the sensation. Then selecting
a secluded spot under the reef, he sank down.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments he was sound asleep. The water surged
about his prostrate form, little fishes came and peered in at
the windows of his helmet.</p>

<p class='c000'>But nothing of this kind woke him. How long he slept he
knew not.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when he woke up all was a glare of light about him.
He was some while collecting his scattered senses.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Then he arose and looked about him. His whole being
thrilled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Saved!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no dream. Not fifty yards distant was the submarine
boat, Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank at once started for it. He reached its side and
clambered over the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>He entered the vestibule and exhausted it of water. Then
he removed his helmet and stepped into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect was startling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford sat by a table looking over some maps. Barney
was engaged in the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford started up with a gasping cry:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heaven preserve us!” he shouted, “it is Frank Reade,
Jr.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was wildly embraced by both.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be the sowl av Pat Murphy s cow, I’m happy onct
more,” cried Barney, turning somersaults across the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—how on earth did you get here, Frank!” cried
Clifford, “we had given you up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have had quite an experience,” said Frank, with a
smile, “but where are the others?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are in the cabin of the galleon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—what has become of the Aurelian?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Driven away by a gale. The coast is clear. Before she
can return we can recover the Donna Veneta’s treasure and
be off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank told his story.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clifford was more than delighted when he learned of the
amount of the galleon’s treasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will cheat old Parker out of it after all!” he cried
wildly. “That is to pay the old scamp for his rascality.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right,” said Frank, and began to put on his helmet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am going down to join Hartley and Pomp, and help
them get the chests of gold out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! What assistance can we be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Keep watch for us and manipulate the searchlight to
our advantage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will do that!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Frank now left the Dolphin. He slid over the rail and
started for the galleon’s hatch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching it, he began to descend, but before he reached
the bottom of the staircase a form slid forward and embraced
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Massy Lordy, if it ain’ Marse Frank. Whereber you cum
from, sah?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is useless to dwell upon that reunion. It was a happy
meeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>It did not take long for them to exchange experiences.
Then Hartley said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“So the Aurelian was driven away by the hurricane, eh?
Well, she will return, you may be sure. Old Gilbert Parker
is a genuine bulldog.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let him return,” said Frank. “We will deal with him
next time as he deserves. It is true that he would have murdered
the whole of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, dat am right!” cried Pomp. “I done fink we bettah
get dat gold abo’d de Dolphin an’ start fo’ home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is just what we will do,” agreed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>So they went to work at once hoisting the chests of gold
out of the Donna Veneta’s hold.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a short while they were all piled up on the sands outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they were easily transported aboard the Dolphin.
The galleon’s hatch was then closed, and it was left with its
ghastly occupants to remain forever buried at the bottom of
the Honduras Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seemed no reason now for lingering in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank had some curiosity to know what was the fate
of the Aurelian, so he sent the Dolphin away toward the
Miller’s Cay in quest of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hurricane had passed, yet Frank did not deem it advisable
to go to the surface. So the Dolphin pursued her
way under water.</p>

<p class='c000'>When at a point which Hartley declared was not two
miles from the Cay, it was decided to go to the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up went the Dolphin; then as she rose above the waves
every eye scanned the watery waste for a sail.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sail was in sight, but not half a mile to windward a
wreck drifted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mercy on us!” cried Frank. “Can it be the Aurelian?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The submarine boat ran nearer to the wreck. Then upon
the stern was read the name “Aurelian.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a shattered, water-logged hulk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a sign of her crew was visible; she was hailed repeatedly,
but no answer came back. Even as the voyagers
were gazing at her she took a sudden plunge and went down.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the last ripples had died away upon the spot where
she disappeared, Frank turned the Dolphin’s head homeward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing was ever seen again of Gilbert Parker, of Captain
Warren, or any of the Aurelian’s crew. It was safe to
say that all had met a deserving fate in the waters of the
Gulf of Honduras.</p>

<p class='c000'>Homeward bound was the Dolphin with her Spanish gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Readestown was safely reached at last. Then followed a
division of the treasure. It made all rich enough.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Clifford and Hartley returned to their homes happy men.
Frank Reade, Jr., went back to his shops and his plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp resumed their duties as of yore, waiting
for the moment when Frank should be impelled to go off on
another cruise to some wonderful part of the world. Until
such time we will bid the reader a kind adieu.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
